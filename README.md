## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Learned how to use Flexbox.

```css
.center {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin-top: 100px;
}
```


### Continued development

I'd like to keep working on ways to display elements. I had some issues with centering elements vertically with Flexbox and had to use a workaround in the end.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Centering Guide](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) - I think I tried every single centering method on this list until I found one that semi-worked.
